Speaker A: Hey, did you manage to, uh, pick up those groceries I asked for?
Speaker B: Oh, um, shoot! I completely forgot. My bad.
Speaker A: No worries. I guess I can just, like, pop out now then.
Speaker B: Well, I can go if you want. I'm, you know, almost ready to head out anyway.
Speaker A: Are you sure? Don't want to put you out, I mean.
Speaker B: Nah, it's fine. What did we need again? Just milk and bread, right?
Speaker A: And some, like, eggs. We're totally out of those.
Speaker B: Got it. Milk, bread, and eggs. Be back in a bit.
Speaker A: Thanks a bunch! You're a lifesaver.
Speaker B: Anytime!
Speaker A: Oh, and grab some coffee, too, if they have the good kind, you know what I mean?
Speaker B: The dark roast? Yeah, I'll keep an eye out, for sure.
